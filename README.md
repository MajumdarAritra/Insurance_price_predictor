# Insurance_price_predictor
# Overview<br>
The Insurance Price Predictor project involves predicting insurance costs based on various customer attributes using machine learning techniques. The goal is to build a model that can estimate insurance charges given features such as age, BMI, number of children, gender, smoking status, and region.<br>

# Features
Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.<br>
Model Training: Development and training of a predictive model using techniques such as Linear Regression.<br>
Model Evaluation: Assessing model performance using metric RÂ² score.<br>
Prediction: Making predictions on new data to estimate insurance costs.
